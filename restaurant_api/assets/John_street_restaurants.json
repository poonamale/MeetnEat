We run live music events throughout the week including free entry New Orleans Jazz each Monday night, featuring Gabriel Garrick with Beached Brass and Hat and Tidy Street Striders alternately. The cafe is open Mon-Fri from 8am until 5pm offering gorgeous breakfasts and lunches with vegan options, using local suppliers with a huge focus on freshness and quality. The Jazz Club itself is a beautifully soundproofed purpose built auditorium that seats 60 comfortably. Home to an Offenbach piano, bass amp, drum kit and PA this is a multi-functional space available for private hire; it works well for parties, workshops, film screenings, exercise classes and rehearsals/filming for music videos. It has hosted some of the finest jazz musicians in the world and is widely regarded as one of the best jazz venues in Europe by musicians and guests alike.

public houses, a real local gem - seemingly tucked away from it all while being smack bang in the heart of the city. Its unique personality is partly due to it's history - rumours of tunnels leading to the Pavilion, debauchery and ghosts - and partly due to the murals and installations from local artists and the interesting calendar of events. Longtime a hub of the queer and LGBT community The Marlborough prides itself on providing a warm welcome to everyone looking for good vibes and fun times. The Marlborough is home to a 60 seat theatre (complete with proscenium arch and velvet curtains) upstairs, which means a constant flow of interesting characters both on stage and through the bar. We are delighted to be the home of Vegan Food Pimp serving great healthy food Tuesday - Sunday at the Marly.","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d4754477-Reviews-Marlborough_Pub_and_Theatre-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html","write_review":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g186273-d4754477-Marlborough_Pub_and_Theatre-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html","ancestors":[{"subcategory":[{"key":"city","name":"City"}],"name":"Brighton","abbrv":null,"location_id":"186273"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"region","name":"Region"}],"name":"Brighton and Hove","abbrv":null,"location_id":"1897554"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"county","name":"County"}],"name":"East Sussex","abbrv":null,"location_id":"186271"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"nation","name":"Nation"}],"name":"England","abbrv":null,"location_id":"186217"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"country","name":"Country"}],"name":"United Kingdom","abbrv":"UK","location_id":"186216"}],"category":{"key":"restaurant","name":"Restaurant"},"subcategory":[{"key":"sit_down","name":"Sit down"}],"parent_display_name":"Brighton","is_jfy_enabled":false,"nearest_metro_station":[],"reviews":[{"id":"711630122","lang":null,"location_id":"0","published_date":"2021-12-02T08:05:58-05:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews?src=711630122#review711630122","travel_date":null,"text":null,"user":null,"title":"Lovely evening out ","owner_response":null,"subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"phone":"+44 1273 570028","website":"http://www.marlboroughtheatre.org.uk","email":"marlborough@drinkinbrighton.co.uk","address_obj":{"street1":"4 Princes Street","street2":null,"city":"Brighton","state":null,"country":"United Kingdom","postalcode":"BN2 1RD"},"address":"4 Princes Street, Brighton BN2 1RD England","hours":{"week_ranges":[[{"open_time":780,"close_time":2130}],[{"open_time":780,"close_time":1380}],[{"open_time":780,"close_time":1470}],[{"open_time":780,"close_time":1470}],[{"open_time":780,"close_time":1470}],[{"open_time":720,"close_time":1560}],[{"open_time":720,"close_time":1560}]],"timezone":"Europe/London"},"is_candidate_for_contact_info_suppression":false,"cuisine":[{"key":"10640","name":"Bar"},{"key":"10670","name":"Pub"},{"key":"10679","name":"Healthy"},{"key":"10686","name":"Street Food"},{"key":"10665","name":"Vegetarian Friendly"}],"dietary_restrictions":[{"key":"10665","name":"Vegetarian Friendly"}],"establishment_types":[{"key":"10591","name":"Restaurants"}]},{"location_id":"21077012","name":"Munchies’ Craft","latitude":"50.821373","longitude":"-0.140127","num_reviews":"79","timezone":"Europe/London","location_string":"Brighton, East Sussex, England","photo":{"images":{"small":{"width":"150","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/d4/ab/46/brunch-with-munchies.jpg","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"width":"50","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/d4/ab/46/brunch-with-munchies.jpg","height":"50"},"original":{"width":"1280","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/d4/ab/46/brunch-with-munchies.jpg","height":"854"},"large":{"width":"1024","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1c/d4/ab/46/brunch-with-munchies.jpg","height":"684"},"medium":{"width":"550","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1c/d4/ab/46/brunch-with-munchies.jpg","height":"367"}},"is_blessed":true,"uploaded_date":"2021-04-07T13:46:07-0400","caption":"Brunch with Munchies' Craft","id":"483699526","helpful_votes":"0","published_date":"2021-04-07T13:46:07-0400","user":{"user_id":null,"member_id":"0","type":"user"}},"awards":[],"doubleclick_zone":"eu.uk.england.east_sussex.brighton","preferred_map_engine":"default","raw_ranking":"4.039483070373535","ranking_geo":"Brighton","ranking_geo_id":"186273","ranking_position":"154","ranking_denominator":"1079","ranking_category":"restaurant","ranking":"#121 of 899 Restaurants in Brighton","distance":"0.3475036037688905","distance_string":"0.3 mi","bearing":"southwest","rating":"4.5","is_closed":false,"open_now_text":"Open Now","is_long_closed":false,"price_level":"","price":"$2 - $16","description":"Munchies’ Craft is your quirky and homey late evening coffee & cocktail house in Brighton town - a cheeky little getaway!
